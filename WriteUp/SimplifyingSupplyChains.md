# Simplifying supply chains 

### The Importance of Forecasting
- Lead time  
- Bull wip
- Price discretion
- Shelf Life
- Estimate revenue/expenses
- Sales effects Per sku cause by shortages
- Promotion Planning
- Target weeks stock
- Ship History
- Build material - tolling
- Vendor managed inventory


### Inference Product Relationships
- Identify items frequently purchased together 
  - When doing a sale on one item what other items are likely to be purchased
  - How should shelves be arranged in accordance to these joint occurrences
  - How will a shortage/surplus affect net sales
- Items effected from missing input materials of related good
- Find true hierarchical nodes (item categories)
- Leverage data generation

### Lokad SC
- Equispace time series
- Vendor managed inventor
- If mis-predict demand must be prepared to liquidate unsold items

### Addressing complexity in data
- Stationarity
- Seasonality
- Trend
- Stochastic
- Inflating dimensionality leads to more trivial solution for gradient decent
- Scaling from monthly aggregates to daily aggregates increases dimensionality but not complexity
- Even deterministic problems have been solved using excludively stochastic or statistical methods
  - Better to be approximately correct than completely wrong
- No real supply chain problem is linear
